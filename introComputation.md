# Introduction to the theory of computation

Resume of Sipser - Introduction to the theory of computation


There are three traditionally central areas of the theory of computation: 

* automata, deals with the definitions and properties of mathematical models of computation.
* computability, certain basic problems cannot be solved by computers. As for example the determination of a mathematical statement has true or false. The theory objective is to classify problems as solvable or not.
* complexity, *What makes some problems computationally hard and others easy?* we don't know the answer to it, but researchers have discovered an elegant scheme for classifying problems according to their computational difficulty.
