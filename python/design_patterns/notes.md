A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design

## Creational patterns

This design patterns is all about class instantiation. This pattern can be
further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns.
While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the
instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively
to get the job done.

**Abstract factory**

> Creates an instance of several families of classes

**Builder**
**Factory Method**
**Object Pool**
**Prototype**
**Singleton**

## Structural patterns

This design patterns is all about Class and Object composition.
Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces.
Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new
functionality.

**Adapter**

> Match interfaces of different classes
